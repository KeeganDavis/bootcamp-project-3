Natural Disasters Visualization
Overview
This project focuses on visualizing data related to natural disasters across the world from 2000 to 2018. Natural disasters pose significant challenges to communities and ecosystems globally, and understanding their distribution and patterns can help in disaster preparedness, response, and mitigation efforts. Through visualization, we aim to explore the frequency, intensity, and geographical distribution of various types of natural disasters during the specified period.
