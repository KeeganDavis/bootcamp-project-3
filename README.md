Natural Disaster Costs and Damage Analysis
Overview
This repository contains the code and data for analyzing the economic impact of natural disasters worldwide. The analysis focuses on assessing the total costs and damages associated with different types of natural disasters across various regions. By examining historical data from the Emergency Events Database (EM-DAT) spanning from 2001 to 2018, we aim to identify trends, patterns, and insights to inform disaster risk management and resilience-building efforts.

Key Findings
Regional Disparities:

Analysis revealed regional variations in the economic impact of natural disasters, with certain regions experiencing disproportionately higher costs.
Dominance of Flood and Storm Disasters:

Flood and storm events emerged as the leading contributors to total costs across all regions analyzed, indicating their significant economic impact globally.
Asia's Vulnerability:

Asia stood out for its high susceptibility to flood and storm disasters, with these events causing the highest economic losses compared to other regions.
Insights into Flood and Storm Impact:

Geographic factors, population density, and climate change were identified as key drivers of flood and storm impact, underscoring the need for proactive risk reduction measures.
Policy Implications:

The findings highlight the importance of investment in resilient infrastructure, early warning systems, and cross-sectoral collaboration to mitigate the economic impact of natural disasters.
